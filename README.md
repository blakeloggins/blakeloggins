## Blake's README
This README is a quick look at how I think, learn, and collaborate. I am here to learn and help make sure our team is successful in any way I can.

### My Journey
**TLDR:** Former Marine with a non-traditional path into tech, now a Forward Deployed Engineer focused on continuous learning through practical, hands-on experience.

After high school, I joined the Marine Corps instead of pursuing college as I had initially planned. What I thought would be a quick enlistment ended up becoming nearly 11 years of service, during which I held a range of unique roles across various parts of the world including Niger, Venezuela, and Portugal.

To transition into a career in tech, I went through [Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA)](https://military.microsoft.com/mssa/), a coding bootcamp focused on transitioning veterans. My first role after the military was with Southwest Airlines, where I was hired through the [Warrior Hire Program](https://careers.southwestair.com/blogarticle/from-the-marines-to-southwest-airlines) as a Cloud DevOps Engineer on the Cloud Security team. At that time, I was new to coding, DevOps, and cloud technology in general. I’m incredibly grateful for the outstanding mentorship and hands-on training I received from talented colleagues, which enabled me to build the foundation of knowledge I rely on today. I owe them everything!

Currently, I’m a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) on the Federal team at Virtru. I’ve gained a lot of knowledge along the way, but I still see myself as a lifelong learner and am eager to expand my expertise with this new team. Although I’m relatively early in my career, I bring both determination and curiosity, and I look forward to continuing to grow in this dynamic field.
